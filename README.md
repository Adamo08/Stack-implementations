# Stack Implementations

This repository contains two different implementations of stacks in C: one using a contiguous representation (arrays) and the other using a linked representation (linked lists).

## Cloning the Repository

To clone the repository, use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Adamo08/Stack-implementations.git.git
cd Stack-implementations.git
```


## Usage

To utilize the stack implementations, adhere to the subsequent steps:

### Contiguous Representation
1. Navigate to the "Piles Representation Contigue" directory:
   ```bash
   cd "Les Piles (Stack)/Piles Representation Contigue"
   ```
2. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   gcc -o main main.c HandleStack.c
   ```
3. Execute the program:
   ```bash
   ./main
   ```

### Linked Representation
1. Access the "Piles Representation Chainee" directory:
   ```bash
   cd "Les Piles (Stack)/Piles Representation Chainee"
   ```
2. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   gcc -o main main.c HandleStack.c
   ```
3. Execute the program:
   ```bash
   ./main
   ```

Ensure that `gcc` is installed and configured correctly on your machine.
